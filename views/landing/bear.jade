                    <p>NightScout is free open-source software created by dozens of experts to help manage the distribution and display of vital blood glucose measurements.&nbsp; It works.</p>
                    <p>But it's a challenging Do-It-Yourself project.</p>
                    <p>We offer the first commercial hosted NightScout service, complete with a curated list of plugins and add-ons.&nbsp; &nbsp;And we relentlessly test our solutions so you don't have to.</p>
                    <p>Some things are just too important to Do-It-Yourself.&nbsp; We have a better way.</p>
